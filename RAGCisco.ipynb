      "modernize and transform their infrastructure in an automated way in order to manage and monitor each connection in real time. Our strategy to help our\n",
      "customers transform their infrastructure with the network at the core began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading\n",

      "•\n",
      "Secure, Agile Networks — Build networking solutions with built-in simplicity, security, agility and automation that can be consumed as-a-service.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Optimized Application Experiences — Enable greater speed, agility and scale of cloud-native applications.\n",

      "Hybrid Work — Deliver highly secure access, a safer workplace and collaboration experiences for the hybrid workforce.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Internet for the Future — Transform connectivity by efficiently meeting the ever-growing demand for low-latency and higher speeds.\n",
      "•\n",
      "End-to-End Security — Build simple, integrated, and high efficacy end-to-end security solutions, delivered on-premise or in the cloud.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Capabilities at the Edge — Develop new capabilities for a distributed world while enhancing the developer experience and extending enterprise and\n",
      "carrier networks.\n",
      "We are continuing to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) across our portfolio to enable further innovation and to empower our\n",
      "customers to drive increased productivity and better user experiences. We are investing in new opportunities in AI, launching new technologies across our\n",
      "product portfolios designed to boost productivity, enhance policy management and simplify tasks. Our AI-scale infrastructure will allow our customers to\n",

      "We are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Historically, our various networking technology products have aligned with\n",
      "their respective product categories. However, increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product categories. As our core networking offerings evolve, we\n",
      "expect we will add more common software features across our core networking platforms. We are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide\n",
      "and the proportion of subscription software offerings. We have various software offerings that fall into the broad categories of subscription arrangements and\n",
      "perpetual licenses. Our subscription arrangements include term software licenses and associated service arrangements, as well as SaaS.\n",

      "The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cisco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2023\n",
      "and fiscal 2022 were each 52-week fiscal years, and fiscal 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year. The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and\n",
      "those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a\n",
      "geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China\n",
      "(APJC).\n",
      "Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The noncontrolling interests\n",
      "attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not\n",

      "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n",
      "(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date\n",
      "of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions.\n",
      "(b) Available-for-Sale Debt Investments   We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt investments. Our available-for-sale\n",
      "debt investments primarily consist of U.S. government, U.S. government agency, non-U.S. government and agency, corporate debt, U.S. agency mortgage-\n",
      "backed securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial\n",
      "institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt investments sold. These investments are recorded in\n",
      "the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other\n",
      "comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax. We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in\n",
      "current operations.\n",
      "(c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:\n",
      "•\n",
      "Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value through income.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less any impairment, plus or\n",
      "minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV)\n",
      "practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to exert significant influence over the investee. These investments are\n",
      "measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n",
      "(d) Impairments of Investments   For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. In this\n",
      "assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a\n",
      "rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If factors indicate a credit loss exists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other\n",
      "income (loss), net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The amount of fair value change relating to all other factors\n",
      "will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n",
      "We hold non-marketable equity and other investments (“privately held investments”) which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We\n",
      "monitor these investments for impairments and make reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on\n",
      "the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies.\n",
      "63\n",
      "Table of Contents\n",
      "(e) Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a\n",
      "first-in, first-out basis. We provide inventory write-downs based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. The\n",
      "write-down is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and charged\n",
      "to the provision for inventory, which is a component of cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is\n",
      "established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. In addition, we\n",
      "record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our\n",
      "future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory.\n",
      "(f) Allowance for Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Financing Receivables   We estimate our allowances for credit losses using relevant available\n",
      "information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss\n",
      "experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. When assessing for credit losses, we determine collectibility by pooling our assets\n",
      "with similar characteristics.\n",
      "The allowances for credit losses are each measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Our internal credit risk ratings are categorized\n",
      "as 1 through 10, with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality. Assets that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual\n",
      "basis. The allowances for credit losses are each measured by multiplying the exposure probability of default, the probability the asset will default within a\n",
      "given time frame, by the loss given default rate, the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default, based on the pool of assets.\n",
      "Probability of default rates are published quarterly by third-party credit agencies. Adjustments to our internal credit risk ratings may take into account\n",
      "including, but not limited to, various customer-specific factors, the potential sovereign risk of the geographic locations in which the customer is operating and\n",
      "macroeconomic conditions. These factors are updated regularly or when facts and circumstances indicate that an update is deemed necessary.\n",
      "(g) Financing Receivables and Guarantees   We provide financing arrangements, including loan receivables and lease receivables, for certain qualified end-user\n",
      "customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and\n",
      "services (including technical support and advanced services), and also may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and\n",
      "integration of our products and services. Loan receivables have terms of one year to three years on average. Lease receivables represent sales-type leases\n",
      "resulting from the sale of Cisco’s and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease\n",
      "receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average.\n",
      "Outstanding financing receivables that are aged 31 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. We do not accrue interest on\n",
      "financing receivables that are considered impaired and more than 120 days past due unless either the receivable has not been collected due to administrative\n",
      "reasons or the receivable is well secured and in the process of collection. Financing receivables may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management’s\n",
      "opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a financing receivable has been categorized as nonaccrual, interest will be\n",
      "recognized when cash is received. A financing receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer’s delinquent balances of principal and\n",
      "interest have been settled, and the customer remains current for an appropriate period.\n",
      "We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing, generally with payment terms\n",
      "ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are\n",
      "derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive a payment for the receivables from the third party based on our standard\n",
      "payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of\n",
      "these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Deferred revenue\n",
      "relating to these financing arrangements is recorded in accordance with revenue recognition policies or for the fair value of the financing guarantees.\n",
      "(h) Leases We lease real estate, information technology (IT) and other equipment and vehicles. We also have arrangements with certain suppliers and contract\n",
      "manufacturers which includes the leasing of dedicated space and equipment costs. Our leases have the option to extend or terminate the lease when it is\n",
      "reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n",
      "As a lessee, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at commencement. Our ROU lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term\n",
      "and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments related to the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the\n",
      "commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use incremental borrowing rates based on information available at\n",
      "the commencement date to determine the present value of our lease payments. Certain of our lease agreements contain variable lease payments. Our variable\n",
      "lease payments can fluctuate depending on the level of activity or the cost of certain services where we have elected to\n",
      "64\n",
      "Table of Contents\n",
      "combine lease and non-lease components. While these payments are not included as part of our lease liabilities, they are recognized as variable lease expense in\n",
      "the period they are incurred.\n",
      "We provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and distributors, for which the income\n",
      "arising from these leases is recognized through interest income. As a lessor, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. We provide leasing\n",
      "arrangements for our equipment to certain qualified customers. Our lease portfolio primarily consists of sales-type leases. We allocate the consideration in a\n",
      "bundled contract with our customers based on relative standalone selling prices of our lease and non-lease components. The residual value on our leased\n",
      "equipment is determined at the inception of the lease based on an analysis of estimates of the value of equipment, market factors and historical customer\n",
      "behavior. Residual value estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and other-than-temporary declines are expensed in the period they occur. Our leases\n",
      "generally provide an end-of-term option for the customer to extend the lease under mutually-agreed terms, return the leased equipment, or purchase the\n",
      "equipment for either the then-market value of the equipment or a pre-determined purchase price. If a customer chooses to terminate their lease prior to the\n",
      "original end of term date, the customer is required to pay all remaining lease payments in full.\n",
      "(i) Depreciation and Amortization     Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization, whenever applicable.\n",
      "Depreciation and amortization expenses for property and equipment were approximately $0.7 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.8 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022, and\n",
      "2021, respectively. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method, generally over the following periods:\n",

      "Based on lease term\n",
      "Furniture and fixtures\n",
      "5 years\n",
      "(j) Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of our acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets\n",
      "acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration\n",
      "over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an\n",
      "indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible\n",
      "asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the\n",
      "business combination and are expensed as incurred.\n",
      "(k) Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets     Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific\n",
      "circumstances dictate, between annual tests. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. Identifying a potential impairment\n",
      "consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at\n",
      "cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. See “Long-Lived Assets” for our policy\n",
      "regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for potential\n",
      "impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired.\n",
      "(l) Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\n",
      "the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted\n",
      "future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management\n",
      "expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at\n",
      "the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\n",
      "(m) Fair Value   Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\n",
      "market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded\n",
      "or disclosed at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we also consider assumptions that market\n",
      "participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\n",
      "65\n",
      "Table of Contents\n",
      "The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs\n",
      "when measuring fair value. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to\n",
      "measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair\n",
      "value measurement.\n",
      "The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\n",
      "Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n",
      "Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for\n",
      "similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less\n",
      "active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable\n",
      "market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market\n",
      "prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of assets or liabilities.\n",
      "Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair\n",
      "value of the assets or liabilities. The fair values are determined based on model-based techniques such as discounted cash flow models using inputs that we\n",
      "could not corroborate with market data.\n",
      "(n) Derivative Instruments   We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. The accounting for\n",
      "changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a\n",
      "fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the\n",
      "risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently\n",
      "reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. For a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign\n",
      "operations, the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within AOCI together with the offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of\n",
      "the underlying foreign operations. For derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in\n",
      "the period of change. We record derivative instruments in the statements of cash flows to operating, investing, or financing activities consistent with the cash\n",
      "flows of the hedged item.\n",
      "Hedge effectiveness for foreign exchange forward contracts used as cash flow hedges is assessed by comparing the change in the fair value of the hedge\n",

      "effectiveness for interest rate swaps is assessed by comparing the change in fair value of the swap with the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to\n",
      "changes in the benchmark interest rate.\n",
      "(o) Foreign Currency Translation   Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, where that local currency is the\n",
      "functional currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with the resulting translation adjustments directly\n",
      "recorded to a separate component of AOCI. Income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Remeasurement adjustments\n",
      "are recorded in other income (loss), net.\n",
      "(p) Concentrations of Risk   Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of\n",
      "insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable\n",
      "credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We seek to mitigate our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk\n",
      "profiles of these counterparties.\n",
      "We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, do not require collateral from our customers.\n",
      "We receive certain of our components from sole suppliers. Additionally, we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide\n",
      "manufacturing services for our products. The inability of a contract manufacturer or supplier to fulfill our supply requirements could materially impact future\n",
      "operating results.\n",
      "(q) Revenue Recognition   We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct\n",
      "and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether\n",
      "arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily\n",
      "available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We\n",
